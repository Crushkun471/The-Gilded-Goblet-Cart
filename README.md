🎮 How to Use

  Use the Sticky Search Bar at the top of the inventory. As you type, the "Available Loot" grid will update instantly.

  Tip: Type "Armor" to see all defensive gear or "Scroll" for magical items.

2. Inspecting Items
  To view an item's description, simply hover your cursor over the item card. An overlay will slide up, revealing the lore and stats of that specific item.

3. Managing Your Pouch
  Add Items: Click "Add to Pouch" on any available item.

  Adjust Quantity: Inside "Your Pouch" (on the right sidebar), use the + and - buttons to change amounts.

  If you have enough Gold, your balance will update, and a delivery will be created.

  If you are short on Gold, the merchant will politely (or not) decline your offer.
